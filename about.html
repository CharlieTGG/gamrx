    <h1>About Gamrx</h1><br><br>
    <p>Hi, and welcome to the Gamrx about page!</p><br><br>
    <h2>gamrx.xyz was created on 8th of June 2024 and was made for only one purpose, to help the owner's Unity games be noticed by the community. This plan obviously took a long time to happen (mostly due to the fact that the owner's Unity games didn't exist yet) but that didn't stop me! I kept on trying and trying to get my games noticed by the community until today, when you are reading this (unless you know me personally) as a random person on the internet. Thank you for taking notice to gamrx.xyz and I hope you enjoy playing my games! Bye!</h2>
