You need to find a way out of this, if you hadn't've killed them, they would've killed you, who wants that, huh? Nobody, absolutely nobody (almost anyway.) This just isn't right! There should be a law against this! Nobody believes you anymore, even your own parents hate you now. What can you do? I'll leave that for you to decide poor little guy.</p>
