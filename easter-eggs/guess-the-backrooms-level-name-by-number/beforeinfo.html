    <title>Backrooms Quiz (HARD)</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>!PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE STARTING THE QUIZ!</h1><br>
    <ul>
        <li>This quiz was made to be as strict as possible so that only TRUE Backrooms fans can succeed, therefore if a level's name is in full caps, answer it in full caps!</li>
        <li>Also, if you try to leave the tab, (only while you're in the quiz) you will be redirected to a secret page, so don't mess this up or you'll have to restart!</li>
        <li>Another thing; all of the answers to this quiz are based before The Purge, this means that only older fans will be able to answer the questions correctly (most of the time.)</li>
        <li>Tip: if the answer to a question has a line through it or is tilted to the side, just write is as it would be without it ("<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">this</span>" would become "this".)</li>
        <li>Tip: every level in this quiz has every word except for "a", "of", "for", (and a few others) beginning with a capital letter so keep that in mind!</li>
        <li>Finally, please don't cheat, I made this for TRUE Backrooms fans to test their knowledge on the various level's names, not for you to sit their and cheat all the way through!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Alright, you're all set, good luck!</p>
