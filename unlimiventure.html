Anyway, you picked up the nearest baseball bat and smashed your window, this alerted the psyco inside your house who then snatched the bat off you and knocked your down with it. Oops!</p>

"Please state your emergency.", "Can I please order a pepperoni pizza with a box of chips and a burger?", "Okay sir, your food is on the way!" Clever, you used the old pizza trick, but you were a bit stupid with it and the murderer wasn't thick. Yes, they got what they deserved, but you ended up with a broken neck. Good job!</p>

You paced upstairs and grabbed an axe from your toolbox. You ran downstairs, entered the bathroom and pounced on your abductor. Yay! You made it out alive! But now the cops are onto you.</p>

You need to find a way out of this, if you hadn't've killed them, they would've killed you, who wants that, huh? Nobody, absolutely nobody (almost anyway.) This just isn't right! There should be a law against this! Nobody believes you anymore, even your own parents hate you now. What can you do? I'll leave that for you to decide poor little guy.</p>
